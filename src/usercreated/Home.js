On the first line of this example you can see what is called a <code>linux hashbang or shebang</code> which is a line that tells your shell what kind of interpreter it should use to execute the following file. Therefore it is possible to create a file with the node hashbang, remove the .js extension en still be able to execute it using <code>./{myscript}</code> where ./ causes it to run.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we got the basics down I am fairly certain you used the express-generator to create your app. Which indeed tells you to run your app using the <code>DEBUG=node:* ./bin/www</code>. The <code>./bin/www/</code> simply runs the <code>www</code> file in the /bin folder. Which is essentially a javascript file with a node hashbang that imports the app instance from <code>app.js</code> and initiates and http server on it, which start listening for events. The <code>DEBUG={name}:*</code> command is used by <code>npm debug</code> <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug\" rel=\"nofollow\">npm debug link</a>. It simply tells the package which debug functions it should use.

It most often has to do with the EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) that the autoscaler is launching your EC2 instances with, and possibly also with the \"user metadata\" that you are passing to the instance when it launches.  These are the only two things that impact what an EC2 instance does when and after it starts up, up until it starts communicating with the outside world.</p>\n\n<p>So what you need to do is create an AMI that is set up so that the right things launch when an EC2 instance is launched from that AMI.  What you'd do is take the AMI you want to use as a starting point, launch that AMI into an instance, make the necessary changes and installations you want, and then save off a new AMI.  Then change your autoscaling group to launch new instances with that new AMI.</p>\n\n<p>You could alternately send a script in your \"user metadata\" that launches things, but this is rarely what you want to do\".  Most of the time, you want to have your AMI do the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>It's also possible that you are using some sort of post-boot provisioner, like Chef, Ansible or Chef Habitat.  If you are, that's where you'd set all of this stuff up.  You'd want that system to do the work you're describing.  But if you're doing that, what I have said earlier still applies.  For this to work, you'd often have also built a custom AMI that has parts of the provisioning system already built into it, so that that system can connect into it and provision it.  It's possible for these systems to start from a generic AMI as well.
